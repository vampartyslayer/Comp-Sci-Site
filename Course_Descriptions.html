      <b> MULTIMEDIA AND WEB PROGRAMMING</b> 
      (Year-long course, meets twice per week)
      In this course, students will be introduced to various techniques of website production using multimedia creation tools,
scripting languages HTML5, CSS3 and web based programming languages JavaScript and P5.js. Students will have
an opportunity to create and publish their own animations and websites. Basic programming vocabulary and problem
solving techniques will be introduced. We will look at Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and the history and technical
underpinnings of the Internet and computer networks. Furthermore we will have several discussions and projects
focused on the social implications of the Internet on society and what it means to be an informed citizen in a digitally
networked world. Prerequisite: None.

    <b>INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER SCIENCE
AND SOCIAL COMPUTING</b>
(Year-long course, meets twice per week)
This course is an introduction to the basic principles of Computer Science and the social transformational effects of
computer technologies. Students will examine computer technologyâ€™s role in the accelerating pace of change and the
expanding influence of social networks. Students will learn the history of computers and the role computer scientists
have played in shaping our world. The course will introduce basic programming concepts and problem solving
techniques. In the second semester students will be introduced to Processing (a Java based computer language) that
explores computer programming through graphics, animation and interactive design projects. The course also features
several creative projects and discussion on current and future applications of computing and its social implications.

  <b>OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
AND DESIGN</b>
(Year-long course, meets twice per week)
This course is a continuation of the material introduced in Introduction to Computer Science. Students will continue their
work with Processing (Java), with an emphasis on understanding and applying object-oriented programming concepts.
Students will complete several projects based on animation, user interaction and game design. Students will also be
introduced to large-scale program design methods that emphasize object-oriented design. The course also features
exploration and discussion on current and future applications of computing and its social implications. Prerequisite:
Introduction to Computer Science and Social Computing, Multimedia and Web Programming, or
permission of instructor.

  <b>DATA STRUCTURES IN PROGRAMMING</b>
(Year-long course, meets twice per week)
This course is a continuation of the material introduced in Object-Oriented Programming and Design. Students will create
a variety of programs that employ advanced programming techniques. The course will focus on the implementation
and use of different data structures and efficient program design. In addition the course will feature discussion of the

inner workings of the computer and theoretical concepts in computer science, and will continue exploration of object-
oriented languages and their application using the programming language Python.

Prerequisite: Object-oriented Programming and Design or permission of instructor.

  <b>ADVANCED PROJECTS IN COMPUTER PROGRAMMING</b>
(Year-long course, meets twice per week)
This course is intended for students that are interested in specialty topics in the computer sciences. Potential topics
include artificial intelligence, computational theory, human-computer interaction, and computer graphics. The course
will be heavily student-directed. Students will complete a small number of large-scale programs designed to extend
their mastery of the field.
Prerequisite: Data Structures in Programming or permission of instructor.
